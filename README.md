# Brain Tumor CNN Classifier

## The Neural Network

This convolutional neural network predicts whether or not a patient has a brain tumor based on an MRI. The model will predict a value close to 0 if the patient is predicted to not have a tumor and a 1 if the patient is predicted to have a tumor. The model uses the pretrained VGG16 base provided by Keras (these layers are untrained in the model) because I found that the model achieved far higher accuracy with it. Since the model only predicts binary categorical values, the model uses a binary crossentropy loss function and has 1 output neuron. The model uses a standard SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a dropout layer to prevent overfitting. The model has an architecture consisting of:
- 1 Horizontal random flip layer (for image preprocessing)
- 1 VGG16 base model (with an input shape of (128, 128, 3))
- 1 Flatten layer
- 1 Dropout layer (with a dropout rate of 0.3)
- 1 Hidden layer (with 256 neurons and a ReLU activation function
- 1 Output layer (with 1 output neuron and a sigmoid activation function)

Note that when running the **brain_tumor_cnn.py** file, you will need to input the paths of the tumor and non-tumor image sets as strings â€” the location for where to put the paths are signified in the file with the words "< PATH TO IMAGES THAT DEPICT A TUMOR >" and "< PATH TO IMAGES THAT DO NOT DEPICT A TUMOR >."

Feel free to further tune the hyperparameters or build upon the model!

## The Dataset
The dataset can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection. Credit for the dataset collection goes to **def me(x)**, **Loai abdalslam**, **Anshu Sinha**, and others on *Kaggle*. Note that the images from the original dataset are resized to 128 x 128 images so that they are more manageable for the model. They are considered RGB by the model (the images have three color channels) because the VGG16 model only accepts images with three color channels. The dataset is not included in the repository because it is too large to stabley upload to Github, so just use the link above to find and download the dataset.
